> The power of the Web is in its universality. 
Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.

> The Web is **fundamentally designed to work for all people**, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.

<cite>W3.org</cite>
